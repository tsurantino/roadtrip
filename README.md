# Road Trip
Road Trip lets you discover great places to visit along the way to your destination. You enter their start and end location at the top and select what types of place you want to see (food, nightlife, recreational, or entertainment). When you click Generate, Road Trip will create the route and then add interactive markers on the map. You can then click on each marker to learn more about each location.

You can try the app [here](http://tsur-roadtrip.herokuapp.com).
