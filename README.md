# Road Trip
Road Trip lets you make the most of your journey by allowing you to discover great places to visit along the way to your destination. You enter the start and end locations at the top and select what types of places that may be of interest to you (e.g. restaurants, bars, entertainment etc.) When you click Generate, Road Trip will create a route with interactive markers indicating places to visit on the journey to your destination. You can then click on each marker to learn more about each spot.

You can try the app [here](http://tsur-roadtrip.herokuapp.com).
